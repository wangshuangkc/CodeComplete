**3.2 Choosing between Sequential and Approaches**

![Sequential and Iterative Approaches](/img/sequential_and_iterative_approaches.jpg)
* Choose Sequential approach
  * Stable requirements
  * Straightforward design and well understood
  * The development team is familiar with the applications sequential_and_iterative_approaches
  * The project contains little risk
  * Long-term predictability
  * High cost to change requirements, design, and code downstream
* Choose Iterative approach
  * Not well understood or unstable requirements
  * Complex and/or challenging design
  * The project contains a lot of risk
  * Unnecessary long-term predictability
  * Low cost of changing requirements, design, and code downstream

**3.4 Requirements checklist**
* Specify functional requirements
  * All inputs and outputs, including source/destination, accuracy, range of values, frequency and format
  * External hardware and software interfaces, communication interfaces including handshaking, error-checking, and communication protocols
  * All tasks the user wants to perform, and data used in and resulting from each task
* Specify quality requirements
  * Definition of success and failure
  * Timing consideration including expected time for operations, processing time, data transfer rate, and system throughput; Space consideration including minimum machine memory and free disk usage
  * Security level
  * Reliability including consequences of software failure, vital information protection from failure, and strategy for error detection and recovery
  * Maintainability of the system, including ability to adapt to changes in specific functionality, OS and interfaces with other software
* Requirements quality
  * Agreed and written in user's language
  * Coherence with other requirements
  * Independent to design and developers
  * At a consistent level of detail
  * Testable
  * Change consideration
* Requirements completeness
  * Areas of incompleteness where information isn't available prior to development
  * Acceptance standards for product's satisfying Requirements
  * Eliminate requirements impossible to implement
